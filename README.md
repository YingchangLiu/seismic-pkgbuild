Some pkgbuild files are from AUR or github. 
These are either poorly maintained or are geophysics-related packages. 
I Have forked them for preservation and reference.
- cuda-multiversion
- intel-oneapi-hpckit (include oneapi-basekit)
- madagascar
- mathematica
- matlab
- miniconda3
- plplot
- seismic-unix



And there is another list of geophysical codes, which are not packaged yet.
- [CREWES]
- [DENISE]
- [Devito], from [SLIM](https://slim.gatech.edu/software/open-source).
- [GMT]
- [HypoDD]
- [k-wave]
- [Obspy]
- [sac]
- [SOFI]
- etc.

The list is not exhaustive. If you are looking for more geophysics-related codes, https://seismo-learn.org/links/codes/ is a good place to start.
